# 🎬 Movix Meta

Movix meta is a movie & tv shows browser built with React and JavaScript. SCSS is used for styling the whole thing. I built this as a side project for learning purpose. The app is fully responsive.

## 🛠 Technologies

- `Vite`
- `React.js`
- `JavaScript`
- `Lazy-Loading`
- `SCSS`
- `Redux toolkit`

## 🕹 Features

Here's what you can do with the app:
- **Search for a movie**: Write a word or a phrase in the search box and you will have the list of movies and tv shows that match with your search term.
- **Movie & Tv Shows**: In the header you got two section movies and tv shows which you can use to browse through all the movies and tv shows.
- **Sorting & Genres**: Find a movie based on the genres or sort them on the basis of their popularity, rating, release date, or even A-Z.
- **Trending & Top Rated**: Find trending and top rated movies and tv shows.
- **Movie & TV show details**: You can see the details of any movie or tv show and even see the top cast and recommended movies or tv show suggestions.

## 📝 What I Learned
Building this project took me a week and here's what I learned:

### 🎣 `useFetch` Hook:
-By creating this hook I got familier with the idea of creating custom hook and helped me seperate the logic of API calls from the components.

### 🧩 Reusable Code
-Building this project helped me learn about how important it is to build the reusable code as much as possible by dividing the code into components and pass data using props.

### 🛒 Redux Toolkit
-Managing state in react is always been a horror story for me but not this time, I learned to create slices, reducers, and setup the store and provide that store to my react app.
